# Upwork Clone Microservice - Auth Service

This is the authentication microservice for the **Upwork Clone** project. It handles user authentication, including login and signup, as part of the larger Upwork-like platform built using microservices architecture.

## Features

- User registration (signup) with validation
- User login with password encryption (bcrypt)
- JWT token generation for session management
- Refresh token mechanism for session persistence

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js** (Backend)
- **TypeScript** (For type safety)
- **Express.js** (Web framework)
- **MongoDB** (Database for user data)
- **bcrypt.js** (Password hashing)
- **jsonwebtoken** (JWT token generation)
- **dotenv** (Environment variable loading)
- **Mongoose** (MongoDB ODM)
- **Nodemon** (For development auto-reloading)



### 4. Run the Application

- **Development mode** (with live reloading):
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Production mode** (after building the TypeScript code):
  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm start
  ```

### 5. Accessing the API

The service runs on port `3000` by default. You can access the authentication routes:

- **POST /api/auth/login** - Login with email and password
- **POST /api/auth/signup** - Register a new user

<!-- ### 6. Testing

This service includes unit and integration tests. You can run them using:

```bash
npm run test
``` -->

### 7. Logs

Logs are generated by the custom `logger.ts` utility and are output to the console.
